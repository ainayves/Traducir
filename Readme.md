## ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¬ TRADUCIR is a translation app based on [Flet](https://flet.dev/).

The idea is :  I would like to use a powerful translator as a desktop app, without going through DEEPL or Google Translate.

It is open-source since it is part of my learning process on Flet. 
So feel free, to send issues or make comments about improving the project.

It is using the openai translation APIs (which is very popular now)

## ðŸ¤– REQUIREMENTS 

Flet requires Python 3.7 or above.
It is a must to read the Flet requirements here : https://flet.dev/docs/guides/python/getting-started

You also need to register on openai to receive your own api key.

## ðŸ’» SETUP

pip install -r requirements.txt

## ðŸš€ Lauch

python main.py
