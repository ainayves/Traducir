## ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¬ TRADUCIR is a translation app based on [Flet](https://flet.dev/)

The idea is :  I would like to use a powerful translator as a desktop app, without going through DEEPL or Google Translate.

It is open-source since it is part of my learning process on Flet. 
So feel free, to contribute , send issues or make comments about improving the project.

It is using the openai translation APIs (which is very popular now)

## ðŸ¤– REQUIREMENTS 

Flet requires Python 3.7 or above.
It is a must to read the Flet requirements here : [flet_requires](https://flet.dev/docs/guides/python/getting-started)

You also need to register on openai to receive your own api key , here : [api_key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## ðŸ’» SETUP


```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## ðŸš€ Lauch
